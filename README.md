# Semantic-Segmentation-Project
This project was developed for the Machine and Deep Learning course at the Politecnico di Torino during the 2023-2024 academic year. It focuses on training a neural network to classify various semantic labels within images from Grand Theft Auto V and then evaluating the model on real-world images from the Cityscapes dataset. The architectures used were DeepLabV2 and BiSeNet.

To address domain shift issues, we applied several data augmentation techniques and utilized advanced methods like Fourier Domain Adaptation (FDA) and Domain Adaptation via Cross-domain Mixed Sampling (DACS).

The project was carried out by Nicola Bavaro, Lorenzo Gargasole, and myself, all students at the Politecnico di Torino. The neural models, dataset, and utils.py were provided by the course's teaching assistants.
